# Using pipeline tools to ensure analyses are reproducible and understandable, using snakemake

This half-day course explains why pipeline tools such as [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/short.html) and [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) are indispensible tools in (reproducible) data analyses.

## Steps of analysis

1. get and clean data
2. fit a model: `ozone ~ temperature`
3. plot the model's fit versus data
4. diagnose any issues with model fit; if necessary, change the model and rerun the above steps

## Applied target steps
