# Using pipeline tools to ensure analyses are reproducible and understandable, using snakemake

This half-day course explains why pipeline tools such as [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/short.html) and [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) are indispensible tools in (reproducible) data analyses.

The `snakemake` code was created by [Isaac Ellman](https://github.com/Ellmen).

## Feedback survey

## Lecture and problem sets
There is a short lecture [here](presentations/pipeline_tools.html).

Applied example: there are two folders:

## Steps of analysis

1. get and clean data
2. fit a model: `ozone ~ temperature`
3. plot the model's fit versus data
4. diagnose any issues with model fit; if necessary, change the model and rerun the above steps

## Applied target steps

TODO

## Prerequisites

- basic Python skills
- some experience of having done data analysis
